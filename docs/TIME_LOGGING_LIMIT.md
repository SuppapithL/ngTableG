# Time Logging Limit Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the 1-day time logging limit feature in the KengtableG application.

## Overview

The application enforces a rule that users cannot log more than 1 day of work for a single calendar day. This includes both task logs and leave logs combined.

## Implementation Details

The 1-day limit is enforced in multiple layers of the application:

### 1. Frontend Validation

#### DateLogsDialog Component

- Added `calculateTotalTimeForDate()` function to compute total time logged for a date
- Added `validateDayLimit()` function to check if adding a log would exceed the 1-day limit
- Applied validation before submitting task logs and leave logs
- Added user-friendly error messages when a log would exceed the limit

#### AddTaskLogDialog Component

- Already had validation logic that checks task and leave logs total
- Displays a validation error if the total would exceed 1 day
- Calculates remaining available time for the selected date

### 2. Backend Validation

#### Task Log Handlers

- Added `validateDayLimit()` function that:
  - Queries the database for existing task logs for the given day and user
  - Queries for leave logs on the same day
  - Calculates the total time that would be logged with the new entry
  - Returns an error if the total exceeds 1 day
- Applied validation in both `createTaskLog` and `updateTaskLog` endpoints
- Ensures the limit is enforced even if frontend validation is bypassed

## How It Works

1. When a user attempts to create or update a task log or leave log:
   - The frontend calculates total existing time already logged for that day
   - If adding the new log would exceed 1 day, an error message is shown
   - The user must reduce the time or choose a different date

2. If the request passes frontend validation and is sent to the API:
   - The backend performs an independent validation check
   - It uses SQL queries to get the exact current state of logs
   - If the total would exceed 1 day, it returns a 400 Bad Request error

## Benefits

- Consistent time tracking across the organization
- Prevents accidentally logging too much time
- Makes reporting more accurate
- Validation at both frontend and backend ensures data integrity
