# Task Estimate Integration

This document outlines the changes made to properly integrate task estimates with tasks in the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `TaskCreateRequest` Interface

Added `estimate_day` as an optional field to the `TaskCreateRequest` interface in `taskService.ts` to allow task creation with an initial time estimate.

### 2. Enhanced Task Service

Modified the `createTask` method in `taskService.ts` to automatically create a task estimate when a task is created with an `estimate_day` value, eliminating the need for a separate call to create the estimate.

### 3. Improved Task Creation Component

- Updated the task creation form handling to properly convert the `estimate_day` input to a number.
- Removed redundant task estimate creation logic from the Tasks component, since it's now handled at the service level.

### 4. Enhanced TaskProgressBar Component

- Fixed progress calculation to correctly use the latest estimate instead of the first estimate.
- Improved handling of cases where no estimates exist for a task.
- Enhanced display of very small progress values (< 1%) to ensure visibility.
- Updated progress bar to show at least a minimal amount of progress when work has been logged.
- Added better formatting for task logs using 2 decimal places for better accuracy.

### 5. Improved TaskEstimatesPage

- Updated the progress display to handle small values better.
- Added special case handling for very small progress (< 1%).
- Improved data formatting for better precision.
- Ensured floating-point calculations are accurate.

### 6. Integration with DateLogsDialog Component

- Added task estimate information to the task log creation dialog.
- When a task is selected, it now fetches and displays the latest estimate for that task.
- Added helpful UI elements to show time estimate information.

### 7. Added Debug Logging

Added console logging throughout the system to help diagnose any issues with task estimate integration.

## How It Works

1. When a user creates a new task with a time estimate, the estimate is automatically saved as a TaskEstimate record.
2. The TaskProgressBar component always uses the most recent estimate to calculate progress.
3. When logging time against a task, users can see the current estimate.
4. All task-related views consistently use the same estimate data.
5. Even very small amounts of work (< 1% of the estimate) are properly displayed in the UI.

## Benefits

- Improved user experience with consistent estimate handling
- Eliminated redundant code
- More accurate progress tracking
- Better visibility of time estimates throughout the application
- Enhanced handling of small task logs
